@article{Anvik2011,
abstract = {A key collaborative hub for many software development projects is the bug report repository. Although its use can improve the software development process in a number of ways, reports added to the repository need to be triaged. A triager determines if a report is meaningful. Meaningful reports are then organized for integration into the project's development process. To assist triagers with their work, this article presents a machine learning approach to create recommenders that assist with a variety of decisions aimed at streamlining the development process. The recommenders created with this approach are accurate; for instance, recommenders for which developer to assign a report that we have created using this approach have a precision between 70\% and 98\% over five open source projects. As the configuration of a recommender for a particular project can require substantial effort and be time consuming, we also present an approach to assist the configuration of such recommenders that significantly lowers the cost of putting a recommender in place for a project. We show that recommenders for which developer should fix a bug can be quickly configured with this approach and that the configured recommenders are within 15\% precision of hand-tuned developer recommenders.},

abstract = {In this study, we compared four expert graders with latent semantic analysis (LSA) to assess short summaries of an expository text. As is well known, there are technical difficulties for LSA to establish a good semantic representation when analyzing short texts. In order to improve the reliability of LSA relative to human graders, we analyzed three new algorithms by two holistic methods used in previous research (Le\'{o}n, Olmos, Escudero, Ca\~{n}as, \& Salmer\'{o}n, 2006). The three new algorithms were (1) the semantic common network algorithm, an adaptation of an algorithm proposed by W. Kintsch (2001, 2002) with respect to LSA as a dynamic model of semantic representation; (2) a best-dimension reduction measure of the latent semantic space, selecting those dimensions that best contribute to improving the LSA assessment of summaries (Hu, Cai, Wiemer-Hastings, Graesser, \& McNamara, 2007); and (3) the Euclidean distance measure, used by Rehder et al. (1998), which incorporates at the same time vector length and the cosine measures. A total of 192 Spanish middle-grade students and 6 experts took part in this study. They read an expository text and produced a short summary. Results showed significantly higher reliability of LSA as a computerized assessment tool for expository text when it used a best-dimension algorithm rather than a standard LSA algorithm. The semantic common network algorithm also showed promising results.},

@article{Somasundaram2012,
abstract = {Software developers, particularly in open-source projects, rely on bug repositories to organize their work. On a bug report, the component field is used to indicate to which team of developers a bug should be routed. Researchers have shown that incorrect categorization of newly received bug reports to components can cause potential delays in the resolution of bug reports. Approaches have been developed that consider the use of machine learning approaches, specifically Support Vector Machines (svm), to automatically categorize bug reports into the appropriate component to help streamline the process of solving a bug. One drawback of an SVM-based approach is that the results of categorization can be uneven across various components in the system if some components receive less reports than others. In this paper, we consider broadening the consistency of the recommendations produced by an automatic approach by investigating three approaches to automating bug report categorization: an approach similar to previous ones based on an SVM classifier and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency(svm-tf-idf), an approach using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with SVM (svm-lda) and an approach using LDA and Kullback Leibler divergence (lda-kl). We found that lda-kl produced recalls similar to those found previously but with better consistency across all components for which bugs must be categorized. 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Top-down process improvement approaches provide a high-level model of what the process of a software development organization should be. Such models are based on the consensus of a designated working group on how software should be developed ormaintained. They are very useful in that they provide general guidelines on where to start improving, and in which order. However, the majority of them have only worked in scenarios within large companies. We aim to help small software development organizations to adopt an iterative approach by providing a Process Improvement Web-based Tool (SysProVal). This paper presents research into the proposal that a small organization may use this tool to define and implement a set of project management practices that can be strengthened using the CMMI-DEV 1.2 model as reference.
